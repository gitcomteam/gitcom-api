# Any PR's are welcome
If you encountered a bug, have an idea about new feature - feel free to open a PR so we can discuss this in detail.

### Technical requirements:
We encourage you to write unit tests and submit them along with your PR (especially for bugs) - this way it will be easier for all of us to keep codebase nice and clean and also make sure that fixed bugs won't appear again in a few days :)
